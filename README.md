## Personal Note
*I've created this software in my leasure time since I found no comparable solution to preview PlantUML diagrams seamlessly in Notepad++. This software (with all its bugs) is not aiming to be an enterprise solution. It surely will not fulfill the needs of everybody. But it maybe is a nice little helper for some of you. I am always open for your reasonable feedback, issues and contributions. Feel free to contact me and have fun with it.*
